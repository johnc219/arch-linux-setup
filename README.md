## Arch Linux Setup
A personal reference for my Arch Linux setup.

The `config` folder contains config files and dotfiles relative to a home directory.
The `installed_packages.txt` file lists all installed packages generated via `yay -Qe`

### usage
To install config files and dotfiles:
1. clone this repo
1. run `config.sh`. Symlinks to these files will be created in home directory. Old config files and dotfiles will be placed in a `./config_backup` directory in this project.
